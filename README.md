<h1 align="center">Password Analyzer</h1>

<p align="center">
  A client-side web tool that evaluates password strength by estimating entropy, brute-force time, and generating SHA-256 hashes.  
  Includes a hacker-style terminal for advanced commands and checks against known password leaks, ensuring privacy and real-time security insights.

## Features

- Real-time password strength assessment (entropy, strength level)
- Estimated brute-force cracking time
- SHA-256 hashing on client side
- Leak detection via Have I Been Pwned API
- Interactive hacker-style terminal with useful commands
- Privacy-first: no password data leaves the client
